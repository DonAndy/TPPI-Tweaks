**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >Modname< (ex. >Buildcraft<)**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
Now I am writing a different book on the new mod

**Begin line after asterisks**
****************************************************************************
