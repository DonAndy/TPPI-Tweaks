**This is the file that TPPI Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**
****************************************************************************
Greetings lovely beta testers, and welcome to TPPI! 
We're really excited to bring this pack to you all.~
~
Hopefully, if this testing period goes smoothly, 
we'll be able to bring it to a lot more people soon!~
~
<3
~~~
This book that you've spawned with is a welcome packet of sorts, 
added by our own cute little mod called TPPI Tweaks.~
~
It will always contain the most up-to-date information 
on the pack, including the latest changelog, so check it 
often!
~~~
The text updates automatically when you open it, so you don't have to 
worry about having to craft a new one each release.~
~
Should you want a new copy, you can craft one with an iron ingot and three paper.
~~~
Another feature of TPPI Tweaks is the in-game commands it adds.~
~
We're working on a project to add in-game documentation for all 
the mods in the pack, to be accessed via commands.
~~~
Type /tppi mods <modname> to view a mod's current documentation, 
and /tppi mods list to see what mods we have documented so far.~
~
Naturally, this is a big job, and it's not yet finished.
~~~
It is our hope that the beta testing team will get 
involved in documenting these mods via our mod's system.~
~
If you'd like to help out, the github link 
for the file that generates the documentation is in the beta reddit's sticky.
~~~
The rest of this book will explain TPPI's unique layer-based 
ore generation system.~
~
Judge has worked really hard on it, 
and we in devland think it's really cool!
~~~
It effectively buffs manual mining significantly, 
while still keeping automatic mining and the amount of ores 
per chunk about the same as we're all used to.~
~
Read on to find out more.~
         Love,~
        -The Dev Team
~~~
The ores you'll find in this modpack will be a little different from what you are used to.~
~
Major metals used by multiple mods now spawn in "bands" of ore at 
more constrained Y levels.
~~~
Ores in a layer spawn more often close to their center Y levels 
(usually a bit lower), unless otherwise stated.~
~
Starting from the top of the world, here are the ores we've tweaked and where you can expect to find them:~
~~~
Copper:~
~
Spawns in the top layers of the world in generous chunks that are centered within the mid 50s, 
with the band itself extending about 5-6 blocks in either direction.~
~~~
TiC Aluminum:~
~
Aluminum can be found in small clusters of 3-4 ores 
randomly distributed between Y levels 44 and 64.~
~~~
Iron:~
~
Iron is located in large clusters centered in the mid 40s of the world, 
and going about 12 blocks in either direction.~
~~~
Tin:~
~
This ore spawns in chunks roughly as large as copper's, centered in the mid 30s, 
again extending up to 6 blocks in either direction.
~~~
Certus Quartz:~
~
Spawns in somewhat sparse, but larger chunks 
randomly distributed between levels 36 and 54.~
~~~
Lead:~
~
You can find this ore in large, somewhat sparse clusters in the mid-upper 20s, 
plus or minus 6.~
~~~
Silver:~
~
You can find this ore directly below and interspersed with lead, 
in slightly smaller chunks.~
~~~
Gold:~
~
You can find this ore in sparse, mid-sized chunks centered in the mid teens of the world, 
with a variance of 6. Appears up to the 20s, but commonly also near lava.~
~~~
Osmium:~
~
You can find osmium from Mekanism in mid-sized clusters centered in the low to mid teens, 
but with a wide variance of 12 blocks in either direction, 
extending from below lava level up to the silver and lead layers.~
~~~
Lapis:~
~
Lapis can be found centered in the low to mid teens, but it has a high variance of 14, 
so it can appear as low as near bedrock and up near silver and lead, with a vein size slightly smaller than diamond.~
~~~
Redstone:~
~
Redstone is spawned in small, 4 ore clusters commonly in the low teens, with a variance of 6, 
with some appearing up where gold is, and some also appearing at and below lava.~
~~~
Magical Crops Essence:~
~
You can find this ore in similar areas as redstone 
in rare, mid-large sized chunks of ore. It spawns in the low teens with a variance of 5 blocks.~
~~~
Diamond:~
~
Diamond is unchanged from vanilla, in that it can spawn anywhere in the first 16 levels of the world. 
Veins are in sparse, small to mid sized clusters anywhere from the levels 1 to 16.~
~~~
Ferrous Ore:~
~
Spawns in mid-sized clusters found randomly between levels 6 and 16.~
~~~
Yellorite:~
~
Spawns in the bottom 9 layers of the world in rare, large chunks of ore. 
Dig below lava to find it. Yay!~
~~~
Coal:~
~
Like normal, with the exception that the ore veins are slightly larger and less frequently placed. 
Spawns anywhere from levels 0 to 128.
~~~
Hugs! Have fun!
