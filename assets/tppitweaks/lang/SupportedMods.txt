**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >Modname< (ex. >Buildcraft<)**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
<http://google.com>

**Begin line after asterisks**

>Thaumcraft<
    Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" the items in the mod before you can craft/make them. In Thaumcraft you can find aura nodes to charge your wand, craft items in special altars, and even use magical robes and tools to improve your gameplay.~
    To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand (look it up in NEI you fool :P). Place a bookshelf on the ground (I prefer the ground, but the roof works too) and tap it with your magical mystic wand of powerfulness! Now you have a thauminomicon, and your ready to be a magician!
