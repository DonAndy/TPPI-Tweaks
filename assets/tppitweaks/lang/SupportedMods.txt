**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >Modname< (ex. >Buildcraft<)**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**You CANNOT have a mod's documentation be both a book and a link, due to current limitations of the mod**
**That means, for mods where you want to link to a wiki, the link should be all that's there under it in this**
**documentation file.**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
and I am typing it on multiple lines 
to make this text file easier to read. 
These lines don't have line breaks between them 
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
<http://google.com>

**Begin line after asterisks**

and some helpful objects to better guide
~~~
the player in the modpack.~

>Thaumcraft<
    Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" the items in the mod before you can craft/make them. 
    In Thaumcraft you can find aura nodes to charge your wand, craft items in special altars, 
    and even use magical robes and tools to improve your gameplay.~
    To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand (look it up in NEI you fool :P). 
    Place a bookshelf on the ground (I prefer the ground, but the roof works too) and tap it with your magical mystic wand of powerfulness! 
    Now you have a thauminomicon, and you're ready to be a magician!

>Tinkers Construct<
    Tinkers Construct is a mod for those people who like to customize their tools, 
    but also adds a way to double ores using a unique mechanic I've never seen in a mod before. 
    It's a very nice alternative to just crafting normal vanilla tools. ~
    Luckily for me, I don't have to to into too much detail since 
    you should've gotten another book in your inventory called "Materials And You" 
    which is your guide to Tinkers Construct.

>Thermal Expansions<
    Thermal Expansion is a tech mod (like IC2, BC, etc.) that uses a power system called Redstone Flux (RF).
    Thermal Expansion has itemducts, fluiducts, and energy conduits, used as "tubes" to transfer their respective
    purpose. It is pretty much self explanatory stuff, after you know the basics, like configuration.
    TE machines always have a config option. Blue is input, orange output, and sometimes there are other colors,
    but it is very easy to understand. If you want to rotate machines, for instance, you can craft TE's "wrench"
    which is called the crecent hammer.
